CS410 Assignment 3:
---------------------

	This is the starting point for a full ray-tracing program. This project reads 3D camera specifications and one or more 3D objects defined in a driver file along with light source specifications and material properties of the objects. Thus rendering a colorful scene. This project only has the illumination model that has the ability to render polygons , spheres, ambient, diffuse and specular reflection and shadows.


How To Run:
------------

To compile:
   	make

To clean:
	make clean

To run:
    	./raytracer <Driver File>.txt  <New File Name>.ppm

For example:
    	./raytracer driver00.txt driver00.ppm
